# Brain-Tumor-Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project detects brain tumors in MRI scans using **YOLOv10** (You Only Look Once v10), a state-of-the-art real-time object detection model. The model is trained on a curated dataset of MRI images and can be used via a Gradio web interface for easy deployment.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **YOLOv10-nano** for lightweight inference
- **Roboflow dataset integration** ([Brain Tumour Detection MRI](https://universe.roboflow.com/computer-vision-by-mehedi/brain-tumour-detection-mri))
- **Gradio UI** for user-friendly predictions
- **Transfer learning** from COCO-pretrained weights

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Dataset sourced from Roboflow in YOLOv8 format (compatible with YOLOv10):
